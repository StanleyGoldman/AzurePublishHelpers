## AzurePublishHelpers for Azure SDK 1.7

This project provides functionality to allow users to deploy web applications with the Azure 1.7 SDK through some CI means.

For an explanation and a howto see my [blog post] (http://www.justaprogrammer.net/2011/10/27/continuous-integration-with-tfs2010-msdeploy-vsdbcmd/)

It started as a fork of the functionality originally provided by [Tom Hollander] (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tomholl/archive/2011/12/06/automated-build-and-deployment-with-windows-azure-sdk-1-6.aspx).
Gurav Mantri's blog [post] (http://gauravmantri.com/2012/09/14/about-windows-azure-publish-settings-file-and-how-to-create-your-own-publish-settings-file/) also provided some key information.
